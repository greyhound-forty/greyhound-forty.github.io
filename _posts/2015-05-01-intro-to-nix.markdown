This tutorial (Introduction to *Nix: Part 1) is for those who are new to Linux, or those who want to review their understanding of fundamental Linux concepts and commands. For beginners, a lot of this material will be new. For more experienced users you can use this as a refresher or jump ahead to [Part 2]() or [Part 3]()

Why does this say *nix? Well I am not going to go down the rabbit hole of the Unix vs Linux discussion so a quick explanation of both:

> Unix: a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, developed in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others  

> Linux: a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution [whose] defining component ... is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released [in] 1991 by Linus Torvalds ↑

### Basic shell commands

While I could list a few dozen commands that I use everyday I think I'll keep this intro section to the top 20 or so most useful for beginners or people looking to refresh their shell-fu. Here are the commands we will be looking at in this section:

+ [pwd](#pwd)
+ [ls](#ls)
+ [cd](#cd)
+ [mkdir](#mkdir)
+ [echo](#echo)
+ [cat](#cat)
+ [mv](#mv)
+ [cp](#cp)
+ [rm](#rm)
+ [man](#man)
+ [less](#less)
+ [more](#more)
+ [head](#head)
+ [tail](#tail)
+ [grep](#grep)
+ [which](#which)
+ [history](#history)
+ [chown](#chown)
+ [chmod](#chmod)
+ [find](#find)
+ [locate](#locate)
+ [clear](#clear)
+ [stat](#stat)
+ [file](#file)

### pwd
To see bash's current working directory, you can type `pwd`

{% highlight bash %}
ryan@bebop [homebase] (master)$ pwd
/home/ryan/homebase

tinybot± pwd
/home/ryan/tinybot
{% endhighlight %}
